# Phone Number Analyzer App
This Python code uses the phonenumbers library to parse and analyze phone numbers input by the user. It extracts information such as timezone, carrier, and geographic location based on the phone number's country code and area code.

# Introduction
In this era of global communication, phone numbers play an important role in connecting people from different parts of the world. However, it can be difficult to determine important information about a phone number such as its timezone, carrier, or location. This is where the phonenumbers library comes in handy. This Python code uses the library to provide users with valuable information about phone numbers.

# Prerequisites
Before running this code, you must have the phonenumbers library installed. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
  pip install phonenumbers
```

# How to use
1. Clone the repository or download the code.

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the code is located.

3. Run the script by typing python Phone Number Analyzer.py in your terminal.

4. When prompted, enter the phone number you want to analyze, including the country code. For example, for a US number, enter +1 650-253-0000.

5. The code will output the phone number in international format, as well as the timezone(s), carrier, and geographic location associated with that number.

Note: If the phone number entered is invalid or of an unsupported type, the code will output an error message.
